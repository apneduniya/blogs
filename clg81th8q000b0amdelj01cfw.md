Are you a developer looking for a new challenge? Are you interested in working with other enthusiasts to solve real-life problems? If so, you won't want to miss Hack4Bengal's upcoming hackathon, which is set to take place offline this year.

Hack4Bengal is a community of over 2300 developers who believe in building for the future and empowering people irrespective of their fields. The group started with just three people in 2021 but has since grown in strength and aims to impact millions of tech talents by providing them with a platform to enhance their skills, collaborate, and create.   

The hackathon is designed to challenge participants to develop innovative solutions to a problem or challenge within a set time limit. It is perfect for young student developers as we are not allowing professionals, providing an ideal platform to showcase your skills, learn something new, and network with fellow enthusiasts. There are six themes to choose from: Quality Education, Good Health & Well-being, Climate Action, Fintech Inclusion for All, Accessible Technology, and Open Innovation for Social Impact.   

The event will take place between April 28th and 30th, and there are exciting prizes and swags up for grabs. The winners of the hackathon will receive TBD prizes, while the first, second, and third teams to make the best use of Solana will receive ₹40,000, ₹20,000, and ₹8,000 respectively. There are also prizes for the best use of Shardeum, Filecoin/FVM, and API by Postman, among others.
